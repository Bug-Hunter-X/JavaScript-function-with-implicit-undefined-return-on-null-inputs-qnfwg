This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript functions that can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with null or undefined values.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version. The bug lies in the implicit handling of null values during the addition operation, resulting in an undefined return instead of explicit error handling or default values.  The solution provides explicit null checks and alternative handling to avoid the undefined return.
